A lot of the commit message details are in the paragraph part. I mean, you may want to read the full commit message of some long commits. 
Interestingly, most of my important commits have really short commit title messages, like "Advance" or "Advance progress". This is because the bulk of the commit message is written in the details, as a diary of some sort.
So yeah, if you are interested in reading some development diary, they are all in the commit details.
